# Krome - Native Blockchain Apps Made Simple

Build blazingly fast, tiny blockchain applications that run natively on all major desktop and mobile platforms.

## What is Krome?

Krome is a framework for building blockchain applications that compile to tiny, native binaries for all major platforms. By leveraging Rust and advanced optimizations, Krome apps are typically under 10MB in size while delivering unmatched performance. It combines the best of modern development tools and frameworks:

- **[Tauri](https://tauri.app)** for secure native cross-platform applications
- **[Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev)** for performant, intuitive UI development
- **[TEVM](https://tevm.sh)** for Ethereum Virtual Machine integration
- **[Deno (TODO)](https://deno.land)** for secure JavaScript runtime
- **[Helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios)** (optional) for trustless light client capabilities

What sets Krome apart is its uncompromising focus on both user experience and developer productivity. Through its opinionated framework, it delivers a polished, native feel for users while maximizing development speed and maintainability for developers.
